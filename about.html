                    <h1>Hi there, I'm Ashley Huang!</h1>
                    <p>I'm a junior at Cornell University studying Information Science with Concentrations in Interactive Technologies and UX Design. My journey has been driven by a fascination with technology's potential to create meaningful and user-centric solutions.</p>
                    <p>From a young age, my creative journey was shaped by my education in arts-focused middle and high schools, where music was central to my life. This background instilled in me a passion for innovation and design, which has guided my exploration into fields like data science, network security, and product design.</p>
                    <p>This journey has culminated in my current focus on product design, where I blend my technical skills with creative thinking to craft innovative solutions. My arts background, combined with my technical expertise, allows me to create user-centered designs that are both functional and engaging. I am driven by a commitment to continuous learning and a desire to apply my diverse experiences to make a meaningful impact in the world of design.</p>
